# What is this?
A self curated curriculum created from reading numerous blogs about bootcamps and what the assignments and lab work were.

#Why?
So self learners can come together around a specific set of problems to learn together because learning alone sucks!

#Stuck, need help?
Currently using slack channel Ruby Developers. Group named #beginners_and_mentors

#What if I need more help?
Would like to have a codementor once a week maybe do a hangout to explain in more detail abstractions and questions we can't answer as a group.

#What if I still need more help?
Then you really do need help.
